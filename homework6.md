Pairwise comparisons between testing and other QA alternatives.


Inspection vs. preventive actions

    Inspection coupled with causal analysis
    Together drive preventive actions
    Key difference: error vs fault focus

Inspection vs. formal verification

        FV ~= formalized inspection
        Focus: people vs. mathematical/logical
        Applicability to design/code only
        Existence of formal specifications
        Tradeoff: formality vs. cost
        Training and acceptability issues
        
Inspection vs. testing

        Existence of the implemented product
        Levels of quality/defects
        Static vs. dynamic defects
        Localized vs. interconnected defects
        Combined approaches
            phases and transitions
            inspection of testing entities/processes
            
Inspection vs. fault tolerance

        Complementary instead of competing
        (e.g., inspect individual versions)
        Static vs. dynamic
        Inspection of FT techniques/mechanisms
