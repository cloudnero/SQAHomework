  Formal methods are part of the solution when imprecise designs and implementations 
that deviating from product specifications or designing intentions are the causes for faults. 
Formal methods will protect the software system against normal loophole. Although formal
methods cann't make it perfect, it makes sure the system has a formal specifications 
being verified or the properties being checked. 
  
  Formal methods are suitable for developing stable product and environments of market. The  
product's requirements will have formal specifications, remain stably, and coordinate with 
later refinements and verifications.

  Model checking is a part of methods to satisfy formal verification. It verifies the correctness
properties of finite-state system automatically. System specifications will be changed to 
temporal logic formulas. Then using efficient symbolic algorithms to traverse the model defined 
by system, and check that whether the specification satisfies or not. Especially with large 
state-spaces that can be finished in minutes. The technique has been applied to several 
complex industrial systems.
