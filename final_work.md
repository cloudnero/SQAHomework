Quality Assurance Plan

Quality assurance (QA) can be viewed to ensure that few, if any, defects remain in the software 
system when it is delivered to its customers or released to the market. Furthermore, we want to 
ensure that these remaining defects will cause minimal disruptions or damages.

Testing methods

white box and black box. "White Box Test" : The tester, to write his code take care of the internal 
structure of the implementation code. With this knoweledge he can easily observe the different 
branches and the cases that can provocated bugs and errors. Eventually the test can call private 
and protected methods.

"Black Box Test" : The tester doesn't take in consideration the code itself, he only tests the 
public part of the tested element.

Functionnal and non functionnal tests

"Functionnal tests :" We speak about functionnal test when a class success to fulfill the fixed 
objective by a given use case. It answers the questions "Does this code made THIS possible ?" 
or "Does this functionnality works ?"

"Non functionnal tests" : They are verificating properties which are not directly used by the code. 
It is to verificate the security or the capicity to handle many requests. It answers the question 
"Does this class can handle 1000 threads at the same time ?"

Unit tests, integrated tests and system tests

While a unit test target to test an isolated unit during the test, an integration test is a test 
that link together different unit/components to verify that they work fine together. System testing 
would be considered as a global integrated test which verify the totality of the assembled system.

Software review

Software engineers will review formally by using reliable technical methods and measures with the 
implementation of well-planned to consider the quality of software testing. Then complete software 
assurance and quality control activities.
